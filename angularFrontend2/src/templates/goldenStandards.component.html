                    Added meaningful, non-redundant comments anywhere that could genuinely use it. Examples:
                </li>
                <li>
                    Followed naming conventions for variable-names/file-names/function-names/etc. Examples:
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use functions to prevent reuse of code as well as modular organization of files/etc for the sake of organization and comprehension. Examples:
                </li>

                    Never used overly confusing logic in places where it wouldn't increase much efficiency(and anytime there was something even somewhat confusing, I added more comments in those parts). Examples:
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensured that no single line of code was too line< and also added spaces to separate different segments of code even if they are in the same scope. Examples:
                </li>
